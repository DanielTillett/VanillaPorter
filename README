Source for Vanilla 2 export tools.

The official release is a single file and can be found here: http://vanillaforums.org/addon/porter-core

You can alternatively upload this entire folder to your web server if you want to use the latest bleeding-edge version or develop your own format. To do so, access it via index.php and ignore vanilla2export.php (the compiled version) entirely.

To create a new export format, add a new file in the format "class.yournewformatname.php" which will automatically be added to the dropdown list of export options. Copy one of the existing classes as an example / starting place. We recommend using a simpler one for this like SMF.

Porter can run via the command line. Execute the index.php file with the --help flag for a full list of options. For developers with very large databases or ones still in production, we recommend running your export from the command line on your localhost environment with a copy of the database.
